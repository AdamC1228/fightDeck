-Purchase the Arduino DUE for use with the fight deck.

-The MEGA will be used for the arcade machine.
     -There will be a dedicated single player control scheme deck as well, but much later.
	 -Will probably use a DUE for this at that point.

-We need a computer for the arcade machine and a monitor.
	 -Will most likely source those from the ACM.
